This approach, of aggressively resetting the styles on a host page with the use of `!important` rules, came about while developing the [BBC World Service widget](http://dharmafly.com/bbc-world-service-widget), where the widget was injected into a page, not with an `iframe`, but a simple `<div>` element (the widget's "lightbox" overlay is similarly just a simple `<div>`). The `!important` styles helped us to prevent any unpredictable CSS "bleeding" into the widget.
