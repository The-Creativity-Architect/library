# LIBRARY
A Library of various Scripts, Layouts, Stylesheets, Snippets, etc used for Website &amp; Front End Development.

Everything within the repository is owned by their respective creators and builders, whose names remain attached to the folder/file of their creation.  Where I could, I attempted to pad out the contact information for the creator.  This included adding additional links to their work that could be found, reviews of their work, and any publicly availble links to contact information should anyone wish to follow-up with any creator regarding their work.
